This project is an AI-driven quiz system built with Django and Vue.js that generates questions using a local Ollama model, supports category-wise and mixed-topic quizzes, and prevents repeated AI questions by saving them in the database. It includes cheating detection through tab switch monitoring, window blur tracking, and camera-based behaviour checks that can auto-submit the quiz on suspicious activity. Users get adaptive difficulty, admins can manage categories and questions, and all quiz results are saved for score history—creating a smart, secure, and automated exam platform.
